Modifications Made:
	1. Added a label to keep track of which operator is selected at the time (lines 97 & 133)
		a. On line 97, the operator clicked is added to the sting: " Operator Selected" and displayed in the operatorLabel
		b. On line 133, when the reset button is clicked, the operatorLabel.Text is set to "No Operator Selected"

	2. Set the TextBox1's text alignment to left and made sure that figures are displayed from right to left (like most calculators)
